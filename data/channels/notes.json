        "text": "A granite rock in the mountain side\nGazed on the world and was satisfied.\nIt watched the centuries come and go,\nIt welcomed the sunlight yet loved the snow,\nIt grieved when the forest was forced to fall,\nYet joyed when steeples rose white and tall\nIn the valley below it, and thrilled to hear\nThe voice of the great town roaring near."
